### What I learned

My focus in this challenge was once again to practice using flexbox to position the elements to match the final output as closely as possible.
I also liked practicing the "media queries" more to get the component to look good on all mobile devices.

### Continued development

I will continue to focus on my mobile first approach before optimizing the layout of the components for bigger screen sizes.
My goal is to become more efficient in styling with CSS/SASS.
